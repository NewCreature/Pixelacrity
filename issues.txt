Quixel 0.1 Issues
-----------------

[X]Modify save routine to utilize import/export code instead of saving entire
   tiles.

   [X]Update canvas_helpers module to handle different rendering scenarios. When
      saving the canvas, we need all of the data in the canvas to be saved.
      Exports should honor flags and other things that affect the final output.

      We can probably get away with adding an ignore_flags argument to the
      rendering functions. We can logically combine the canvas flags with the
      ignore_flags parameter and use the result as our flags. This would allow
      us to use the same function as our final export routine as well as saving
      the canvas data into our internal file format.

      Ultimately, we want the raw image data to make it into the saved data
      when saving our canvas. Then we import that information back into a new
      canvas instead of loading the canvas directly like we do now.

[ ]Add ability to import image files.

   [ ]Add UI for importing images (menu, file dialog, etc.).

[ ]Add ability to export image files.

   [ ]Add a way to specify the area we want to export.

      [ ]We should default to exporting the whole image if no area is specified.

   [ ]Need to implement visible area settings.

[ ]Finish implementing color selection.

   [X]Add color palette.

   [X]Add current colors element.

   [ ]Finish color picker element implementation.

      [X]Investigate why t3gui_slider_proc() crashes with the default theme.

      [X]Add slider for setting color shade.

         [X]Add a color element for the slider and update the color based on the
            position of the slider.

      [X]Add slider for setting color alpha.

         [X]Add a color element for the slider and update the color based on the
            position of the slider.

      [ ]Update position of slider based on the lightness value of the selected
         color. We might want to move the black and white color elements on the
         color picker to be adjacent to the other shades so the slider will
         correspond exactly with the shade selected.

      [ ]Offer 9 shades of current base color in addition to black and white.

         [ ]Separate the black and white color elements from the main color
            picker element.

            [ ]Fix position of white.
